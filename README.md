## Technologies

- MVVM
- Flow
- Retrofit
- OkHttp
- Gson
- Room
- Coroutines
- Koin
- JUnit
- Mockk

## Requirements

- the task must be done in **Kotlin**
- there are no strict restrictions on time
- third-party libraries, tools, frameworks can be used
- the system should be maintainable & expandable:
    - a clear relationship between the parts of the code
    - the code is understandable, simple, readable
    - the addition of a new functionality or an existing change should not require rewriting the
      entire system
    - adding new currency should be easy
    - provide for the possibility of expanding the calculation of a more flexible commission. It is
      possible to come up with various new rules, for example - every tenth conversion is free,
      conversion of up to `200 Euros` is free of charge etc.
- balance must be visible somewhere in the UI
- balance can't be negative after the conversion
- the code should conform to the selected code standards (e.g. google java style guide, square java
  style guide).
- it would be best to test the app before the submission of code.

# Evaluation

- all requirements are met
- code quality
- knowledge of Android ecosystem - libraries, frameworks
- knowledge of best practices, design & architecture patterns
- (insanely) great UI/UX is an advantage
- providing UnitTests is a plus
